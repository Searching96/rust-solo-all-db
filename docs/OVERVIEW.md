🔥 Excellent choice!
**Building an embedded database & storage engine** is *the* kind of Rust project that:
✅ Shows off low-level systems programming
✅ Proves deep understanding of ownership, lifetimes, concurrency, and traits
✅ Can evolve into a powerful real-world product

Here’s a detailed **project roadmap** & how each part highlights Rust's unique strengths:

---

## 🧩 **Cluster 1: Build Your Own Database / Storage Engine**

### 🛠 **Phase 1 – Core Storage Engine**

#### 📦 Project: Embedded KV store with LSM tree or B+ tree

* Write your own B+ tree or log-structured merge tree
* Use file I/O & memory-mapped files (`memmap2` crate)
* Manage lifetimes when returning slices / data views safely
* Show zero-cost abstractions, ownership of disk & memory buffers
* Handle compaction & recovery
* **Rust strength**:

  * Fine control over memory
  * Safe low-level file & buffer handling
  * No GC, but no segfaults

---

### 🧰 **Phase 2 – Data Processing Pipeline / ETL**

#### 📦 Project: Pipeline to ingest CSV → store into your DB

* Use `serde` + `csv` crate to parse data
* Parse → transform → write in parallel (threads or async)
* Use channels (`crossbeam`) to pipeline stages
* **Rust strength**:

  * Concurrency via channels or thread pools
  * Strong typing prevents data format bugs
  * `Option`/`Result` and pattern matching to handle parse errors

---

### 🧪 **Phase 3 – Query Engine / Interpreter**

#### 📦 Project: Implement a mini SQL-like query parser & executor

* Use enums & pattern matching for AST & execution plans
* Apply traits for different operators (filter, join, aggregate)
* Handle lifetimes when planning & executing queries
* **Rust strength**:

  * Rich enums, exhaustive matching
  * Traits & generics to abstract over data sources or operators
  * Clear error handling with `Result`

---

### 🧰 **Phase 4 – Procedural Macro (optional but cool)**

#### 📦 Project: `#[derive(QueryBuilder)]`

* Generates Rust code to query your DB from structs
* Uses `syn` & `quote` crates
* Showcases meta-programming in Rust
* **Rust strength**:

  * Compile-time code generation
  * Type-safe query building

---

### ⚙ **Phase 5 – Background Compaction / Concurrency**

#### 📦 Project: Compaction thread or snapshotting

* Run background threads to merge LSM tree files
* Use `parking_lot` or `tokio` if async
* Carefully design synchronization: RwLock, Mutex, atomic counters
* **Rust strength**:

  * Send + Sync traits ensure thread safety
  * Ownership ensures no data races

---

## 🌱 **How it becomes a bigger project:**

All together → you build:
✅ Embedded, zero-dependency DB engine (like SQLite, but Rust)
✅ Type-safe, macro-based Rust query builder
✅ Parallel data loader for analytics workloads
✅ Query execution engine for OLAP / simple SQL

---

## 🔧 **Crates you might use:**

| Purpose           | Crate                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| File mmap         | `memmap2`                  |
| Concurrency       | `crossbeam`, `parking_lot` |
| Parsing           | `nom` or `pest`            |
| Procedural macros | `syn`, `quote`             |
| Serialization     | `serde`                    |
| Async (optional)  | `tokio`                    |

---

## ✅ **Why this *really* shows Rust’s power:**

* Lifetimes & borrowing: manage data buffers safely without cloning
* Enums & pattern matching: model AST & query plans cleanly
* Traits & generics: flexible query operators
* Concurrency: multithreading with safety (no data races, compile-checked)
* Meta-programming: procedural macros to improve developer ergonomics

---

## 📦 **Result:**

A truly advanced solo Rust project, impressive to:

* Interviewers / portfolio reviewers
* Other Rustaceans
  And it’s genuinely *useful*.
